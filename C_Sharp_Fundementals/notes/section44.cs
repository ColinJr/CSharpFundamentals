//Types of loops and iteration statements
//    For loops, Foreach loops, While loops, and do while loops

//    For loops:
//for (var i = 0; i < 10; if++)
//{

//}
//For loops have 3 parts,
//    "(var i = 0;" is the initialization clause, the starting input of the loop
//    "i < 10" is the condition clause, as long as the condition is fulfilled the loop will continue
//    "i++)" is the iteration clause, where the condition shifts to iterate on the loop
//foreach (var number in numbers)
//    {

//}

//while loops
//while (condition)
//    {
//        // code block to be executed
//    }
//break
//jumps out of loop, 
   
//continue 
//jumps to next iteration
